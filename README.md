# Fountain with lights
## Work methods
The fountain works in 2 modes. Each mode lasts 60 seconds and the cycle must be completed. The working hours of the fountain are on weekdays from 17:00 to 23:00 and on weekends from 20:00 to 02:00. The clock speed is regulated by a potentiometer connected to the analog card.
